Welcome to SuperOffers, a university project that leverages data from [e-katanalotis.gov.gr](https://e-katanalotis.gov.gr/) to create a platform where users can submit supermarket offers, rate offers uploaded by others, and earn points based on the community's feedback. Additionally, the application features an admin interface for statistical analysis, offer submission, and content management.

### 3. Admin Interface 👩‍💼
Admins have access to a dedicated interface where they can view statistics, submit offers on behalf of supermarkets, and manage the content by deleting inappropriate or outdated offers.
